# Project_-Face-Emotion-Recognition-using-Deep-Learning

Project Overview
This mini-project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize human emotions from facial expressions. The goal is to classify facial images into distinct emotion categories such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, etc., using deep learning techniques.

Problem Statement
Recognizing emotions through facial expressions is a key area in computer vision. This project implements a deep learning model to predict emotions from grayscale facial images with the help of the FER-2013 dataset.

Key Objectives
Preprocess and augment facial image data.
Build a CNN for feature extraction and classification.
Train, validate, and test the model.
Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics.
Predict emotions on unseen images.

 Dataset: [FER-2013 - Facial Expression Recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013)
